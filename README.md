# SAFEGAMES-ISP-GAME
Bill Bai and Erfan Yeganehfar's game for ICS4UO final project. Written in Java, using the LibGDX library.
Follow Gekyume on his adventure to escape the Safety4Kids game in this interactive learning platformer.

This program uses a gradle project to bundle the LibGDX libraries with the program. If you would like to run the program, make sure that you are running a gradle project.
if any warnings are expressed during the program it is due to the old version of gradle that the project must run on. It does not affect the program. 
Importing a gradle project can be found at: https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation/gettingstarted/Importing%20into%20IDE.html

NOTE:Some school computers may not be able to run this game due to outdated video drivers unable to run OpenGL2, most computers are capable yet this should be considered.
